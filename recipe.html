  <img src="Egusi-soup-768x1152.jpg.webp" width=300 height=300 alt="Photo of cooked egusi soup">
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul> 
<li>Egusi melon</li>
<li>Palm oil</li>
<li>Beef, dried fish, and crayfish</li>
<li>Locust beans</li>
<li>Spinach</li>
<li>Pepper mix</li>
<li>Onions</li>
<li>Salt</li>
<li>Stock cube</li>
<li>Beef stock</li>
</ul>
<h2>Preparation steps</h2>
<p>Step 1: Blend the peppers and onions together</p>
<p>Step 2: Blend the Egusi melon</p>
<p>Step 3: Heat the palm oil but don't overheat</p>
<p>Step 4: Add onions and locust beans</p>
<p>Step 5: Add the blended pepper</p>
<p>Step 6: Add the remaining locust beans, beef stock, and salt to taste. Cover and leave for 5 minutes</p>
<p>Step 7: Gently introduce the blended egusi inside the sauce but don’t stir it at this point. Just cover it and leave it to cook for about 20 to 30 minutes. Keep an eye on it, so it doesn’t burn but try not to stir it until the Egusi turns into a soft compact mass. Then, gently stir together and add more stock or water if necessary</p>
<p>Step 8: Add the fish and meat and cook for another 5 minutes.</p>
<p>Step 9: Stir in the spinach and leave to simmer for about 5 minutes(stir constantly). Adjust the seasoning if necessary.</p>

<h2>Tips and Variations</h2>
<p>Tip 1: If you are a vegetarian, you can still eat Egusi soup. Omit the meat and beef broth. You can replace it with vegetable broth.</p>
<p>Tip 2: If you are worried about calories from palm oil, you can reduce the quantity you use.</p>
<p>Tip 3: Use as many leafy vegetables as you like; there is no limit to the quantity.</p>
<p>Tip 4: Blend the pepper with little water. Avoid watery pepper mix because too much water will prolong the cooking time of the sauce</p>
<p>Variation: Spinach was used in the making of this recipe but any leafy greens can be used as a substitute</p>
